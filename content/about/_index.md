Hi!

First of all, thank you for showing interest in my work and me!

My name is Andreas and I am currently studying Computer Science at TU Munich. I have quite many personal interests and I use this website to note down and share some interesting things I came across in some of my projects. So don't expect any particular topic here.

Thanks for reading!
