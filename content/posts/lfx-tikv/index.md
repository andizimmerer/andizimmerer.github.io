title: "My Journey to Becoming a TiKV Contributor"
date: 2021-05-31
summary: "I had the pleasure the work on TiKV, a distributed key-value store in Rust that serves as a storage engine for TiDB, as an LFX Program Mentee in 2021. The goal was to implement a \"pluggable\" coprocessor, similar to HBase's coprocessor, where users can leverage the computational power of storage nodes and directory execute arbitrary computation on them."
