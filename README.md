This website is created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a lightning fast static-site generator written in Go.

A short primer for me because I constantly forget how to work with Hugo:

1. Create a new post:  
   ```
   hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
   ```
2. Start development server (with drafts enabled):  
   ```
   hugo server -D
   ```
3. Build a static page  
   ```
   hugo
   ```
