Personal Website
================

This website is created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

A short primer for me because I constantly forget how to work with Hugo:

1. Create a new post:  
   ```
   hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
   ```

2. Content is available in the `posts/` directory.

3. Start development server (with drafts enabled):  
   ```
   hugo server -D
   ```
4. Build a static page  
   ```
   hugo
   ```
